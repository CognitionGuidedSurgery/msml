3D-IRCADb (3D Image Reconstruction for Comparison of Algorithm Database) is a database includes several sets of anonymized medical images of patients and the manual segmentation of the various structures of interest performed by clinical experts. The 3D medical images and masks of the segmented structures of interest are available as DICOM files. The representation of segmented zones is also provided as surface meshes in VTK format. This database will soon be completed with new cases.

The objective of this database is to compare segmentation algorithms mesh generation algorithms and breathing simulation algorithms. Moreover, the database can be used within the framework of anatomical education or medical simulation.

In the future, this database will be completed by many other cases. Moreover, the automated segmentation of structures of interest will also be added so as to offer an efficient tool to the scientific community for the comparison of algorithms.
